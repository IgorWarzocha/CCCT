Please systematically explore the codebase before coding: $ARGUMENTS

Refocus on global CLAUDE.md and project CLAUDE.md for context and rules.

Follow these steps:

1. **Create Workspace** - `mkdir -p /explore/$ARGUMENTS` (permanent documentation)
2. **Read Key Files** - Identify and read relevant files without making changes
3. **Document Findings** - Create `/explore/$ARGUMENTS/findings.md` with:
   - File structure overview
   - Key functions/classes discovered
   - Dependencies and relationships
   - Implementation approaches
4. **Create Architecture Map** - Document in `/explore/$ARGUMENTS/architecture.md`
5. **Present Summary** - Share findings for approval before coding

Files remain for future reference and team knowledge sharing.
