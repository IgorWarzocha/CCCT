# Acknowledgments

This system builds upon excellent foundations and inspiration from:

## Core Inspirations

### [claude-task-master](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master)
- **Contribution**: Task management and structured workflow concepts
- **Influence**: Systematic approach to breaking down complex development tasks
- **Integration**: Forms the basis for our dual tracking and complexity analysis systems

### [ai-dev-tasks](https://github.com/snarktank/ai-dev-tasks)  
- **Contribution**: Development workflow patterns and best practices
- **Influence**: Professional development process integration
- **Integration**: Inspired our GitHub workflow integration and quality gates

## Claude Code Ecosystem

### [Anthropic Claude Code Documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)
- **Slash Commands**: Foundation for our extensible command system
- **Workflow Integration**: Guidelines for professional development integration
- **Best Practices**: AI-first development principles

## Design Philosophy

This system extends and integrates these inspirations to create:

- **Unified Workflow**: Single system handling PRD → Tasks → Implementation
- **Complexity Intelligence**: Smart task breakdown based on scope, technical, and risk factors  
- **Dual Tracking**: Perfect sync between Claude's awareness and project documentation
- **Research Integration**: External LLM research prompts for comprehensive requirements
- **Professional Git Flow**: Automatic branching, PR creation, and quality gates

## Community Contributions

Special thanks to the Claude Code community for:
- **Workflow Patterns**: Shared approaches to AI-assisted development
- **Tool Integration**: Methods for connecting Claude with existing development tools
- **Quality Standards**: Practices for maintaining code quality with AI assistance

## Contributing Back

This system is open source to give back to the community that made it possible. We encourage:
- **Extensions**: New commands for specific workflows
- **Improvements**: Enhanced complexity analysis and tracking
- **Integrations**: Connections with additional development tools
- **Documentation**: Better guides and examples

The goal is to create a robust, professional workflow system that benefits the entire Claude Code ecosystem while honoring the excellent work that came before.
