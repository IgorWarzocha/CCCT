# CCCT System Summary

## What This System Replaces

### Default Claude Code Workflow
- **OLD**: `/init` command for basic project setup
- **NEW**: `/setup` + `/explore` for comprehensive initialization

### Key Improvements
- **Integrated complexity analysis** drives smart task breakdown
- **Dual tracking system** keeps TodoWrite and files synchronized
- **Research-driven PRDs** with external LLM integration
- **GitHub workflow integration** with automatic branching and PR creation
- **Cross-platform support** for Linux, macOS, and Windows

## Complete Workflow Chain

```
Project Start → /setup → /explore → /prd [feature] → /todo [task] → /dev [issues] → /review → Complete
```

### 1. Project Initialization
- `/setup` - Creates CLAUDE.md, installs templates, sets up structure
- `/explore` - Deep codebase analysis and documentation

### 2. Feature Development  
- `/prd [feature]` - Research-driven requirements with Q&A
- `/todo [task]` - Task execution with complexity analysis and dual tracking
- `/dev [specific-issues]` - TDD workflow with GitHub integration

### 3. Quality & Collaboration
- `/review [code]` - Structured code review process
- `/parallel [work]` - Coordinate multiple development streams
- `/sub [agents]` - Manage AI agent collaboration

## Core Innovations

### Complexity-Driven Development
- **3-factor scoring**: Scope + Technical + Risk = Smart decisions
- **Automatic task sizing**: Low/Medium/High → subtask count + model recommendations
- **Parallel identification**: New components = parallel-safe, shared state = sequential

### Dual Tracking Architecture
- **TodoWrite**: Claude's internal awareness and progress tracking
- **File System**: Persistent project documentation (`./tasks/*.md`)
- **Perfect sync**: Both systems updated simultaneously throughout execution
- **Archive system**: Completed tasks moved to `./tasks/completed/`

### Research Integration
- **External LLM prompts**: Claude Code generates research prompts for you to run elsewhere
- **Comprehensive analysis**: Market research, technical approaches, UX patterns
- **Informed PRDs**: Research findings incorporated into requirements documents

## Technical Architecture

### Global Commands (9)
- **Universal paths**: `~/.claude/commands/` (cross-platform)
- **No hardcoded references**: All paths relative or user-agnostic
- **Modular design**: Each command focused on specific workflow aspect

### Task Templates (3)
- **Integrated complexity**: Embedded in generation, not separate
- **Dual tracking protocol**: Instructions for maintaining both systems
- **GitHub workflow**: Branching, PR creation, issue management

## Installation Requirements

### Must-Have Prerequisites
1. **Global CLAUDE.md configured** with your development principles
2. **Claude Code CLI** installed and working
3. **Git + GitHub CLI** authenticated and ready
4. **Cross-platform compatibility** (Linux/macOS/Windows)

### Installation Process
1. Copy `commands/*.md` → `~/.claude/commands/`
2. Copy `tasks/*.md` → `./tasks/` (per project)
3. Use `/setup` + `/explore` instead of default `/init`
4. Start professional workflow chain

## Why This System Works

### AI-First Design Principles
- **Modular components**: Small, reusable, independent parts
- **Lean implementations**: No bloat, only essential features
- **Decision-focused**: Complexity analysis drives practical choices
- **Test integrity**: Fix code, never modify tests

### Professional Workflow Integration
- **GitHub-native**: Issues, branches, PRs built into every workflow
- **Documentation-driven**: Persistent project knowledge in files
- **Quality gates**: Testing and review integrated at every step
- **Team coordination**: Multiple developers and AI agents supported

### Universal Compatibility
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Linux, macOS, Windows
- **Project-agnostic**: Adapts to any codebase structure  
- **Language-neutral**: Supports any tech stack
- **Tool-flexible**: Uses existing project tools (npm, pytest, etc.)

## Success Metrics

### Before CCCT
- Ad-hoc task management
- Inconsistent project initialization
- Manual GitHub workflow steps
- Complexity assessment guesswork
- Tool tracking disconnected from project documentation

### After CCCT
- **Systematic workflow**: PRD → Tasks → Implementation chain
- **Smart task breakdown**: Complexity-driven decisions
- **Perfect tracking**: TodoWrite ↔ files always synchronized
- **Professional Git workflow**: Automatic branching and PR creation
- **Research-informed development**: External LLM insights integrated

This system transforms Claude Code from a powerful but ad-hoc tool into a professional, systematic development workflow engine.
